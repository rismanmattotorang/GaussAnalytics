//! Golden-file tests: fixed GQL inputs compiled to expected SQL per dialect.
//!
//! These lock down the compiler's output so semantic drift is caught early — the
//! Rust analogue of the reference engine's query-processor regression suite. As
//! more databases are supported, add their dialect rows here.
